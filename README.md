In order to use the program JavaFX is required.
To play sounds one needs to download the following API http://www.softsynth.com/jsyn/developers/archives/jsyn-20171016.jar
It also need to be added to the projects build path. 

An executable jar file is also submitted. This will bypass these requirements. 

This first phase of the coding process was dominated by all group members learning the core functionality of JavaFX. 
In order to facilitate the learning process each group member made one version each. 
This code is a combination of every group members version.

Since we mainly focused on learning JavaFX during this sprint the functionality is at the moment is very rudimentary.
